Notes

Sunday - July 5

	- looking through the training set, there seems to be certain kinds of errors:
		1. "cup stains" - marked by large dark stain where a cup would have been.
		2. "dark circles" - small dark circles like coffee drops
		3. "crease" - creases
		4. "shadows" - caused where close to creases, shadows form.
		5. "darkness" - some random darkness
		6. "crumble" - heavy creasing and shadowing

	- On the training set:
		- different fonts, but all same lighting (filters and thresholds might work?)
		- finally, we want black and white image. Black for letters and white background.
